I am a senior year Computer Engineering student at Middle East Technical University. My research interests include Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. 

I am also working as an undergraduate researcher at University of Cambridge under the supervision of Dr Hatice Gunes in the Affective Intelligence and Robotics Lab (AFAR). My current research focuses on Facial Reaction Prediction using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).
